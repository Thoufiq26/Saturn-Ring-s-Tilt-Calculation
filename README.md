<h1 color="blue">Saturn Ring Tilt Calculation and Visualization</h1>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
This project calculates and visualizes the tilt of Saturn's rings as seen from Earth. The tilt changes based on Saturn’s position in its orbit and affects how visible the rings are.

<h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
Tilt Angle: Determines which side of Saturn's rings is visible:
Positive tilt: Northern side of the rings is visible.
Negative tilt: Southern side of the rings is visible.

<h3>Visibility:</h3>
Maximum Tilt: Rings appear wide and bright.
Edge-On (0° Tilt): Rings appear thin and nearly invisible.

<h3>Features:</h3>
Current Tilt: Calculate the current tilt of Saturn’s rings or for a specific date.
Tilt Over Time: Visualize how the tilt angle evolves over a given period (e.g., years).

<h3>Use Case:</h3>
Useful for astronomers and space enthusiasts to predict Saturn's ring visibility and plan observations.
